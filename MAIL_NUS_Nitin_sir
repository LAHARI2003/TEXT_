Dear Sir ,

I am Kommalapati Lahari, a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from IIT Patna, currently working as an intern at STMicroelectronics in their R&D division. I am applying for my PhD at NUS in the field of Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, Deep Learning, and their applications.

During my undergraduate studies, I was always inclined toward pursuing a PhD, and I recognized that such a path would require persistence, patience, and consistency. My experience at STMicroelectronics has been transformative, providing me with opportunities to handle complex tasks and overcome challenges. This journey has not only strengthened my technical skills but has also reinforced my confidence and commitment to pursuing advanced research.

One of the most significant hurdles I encountered was in High-Level Synthesis (HLS), where the absence of established repositories or reference codebases meant I had to independently navigate the design space for HLS C++ code generation. This required me to experiment with different syntaxes for synthesis, understand the intricacies of memory assignment, and master techniques such as array partitioning. Additionally, I had to deeply understand how pipelining and loop unrolling techniques contribute to code optimization, improving both performance and resource utilization in hardware accelerated environments. 

Delving into LLM frameworks, particularly the OpenAI SDK framework, and implementing agentic workflows further demanded a strong grasp of foundational concepts in natural language processing. My work on the NVDLA (NVIDIA Deep Learning Accelerator) codebase also deepened my technical understanding, particularly in debugging, code analysis, and problem solving within complex hardware accelerated systems.

I wanted to take this opportunity to provide you with a comprehensive overview of my research journey and accomplishments here at ST, which I believe will effectively demonstrate my passion and commitment to pursuing a PhD in this field. For a detailed account of my research journey and academic experiences prior to my time at ST, I have attached my Statement of Purpose and Resume. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to your feedback and support.


Best Regards,

Kommalapati Lahari
